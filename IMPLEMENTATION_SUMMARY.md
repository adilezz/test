    "pages": 62
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-24T..."
}
```

### 3. Tree View Response Structure

All tree endpoints return hierarchical JSON with consistent structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name_fr": "Name in French",
    "name_ar": "Name in Arabic", 
    "name_en": "Name in English",
    "type": "university|faculty|department|school|category|geographic",
    "children": [...],
    "thesis_count": 42,  // if requested
    "additional_fields": "..."
  }
]
```

GET /admin/categories/tree?include_theses_count=true
```

### 4. Get Schools Hierarchy
```bash
GET /admin/schools/tree?include_departments=true
```

## Testing Recommendations ðŸ§ª

### API Testing
```python
# Test tree endpoint with all parameters
response = client.get("/admin/universities/tree", params={
    "include_faculties": True,
    "include_departments": True,
    "include_theses_count": True
})
assert response.status_code == 200
assert "children" in response.json()[0]

# Test pagination
response = client.get("/theses", params={
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 25,
    "q": "test"
})
assert response.json()["meta"]["page"] == 2
assert len(response.json()["data"]) <= 25
```
