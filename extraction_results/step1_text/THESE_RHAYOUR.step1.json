  "abstract_en": "ABSTRACT \n The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of  oregano and clove e ssential oils (EO) \nwas studied simultaneously with two phenolic components, namely thymol and eugenol . \nEscherichia coli  (E. coli ) and Bacillus subtilis  (B. subtilis ) were used as Gram negative and \nGram positive bacterial model respectively. Th e same study was made with Mycobacterium \n(M.phlei and M. fortuitum ). \nThe EO as well as their  major components were capable of inducing cell lysis. Bacteria lysis \nwas shown by the release of substa nces absorbing at 260 nm. For E. coli , the results were \nsimilar to those obtained with polymyxin B. Scanning electronic microscope observations \nrevealed that both cell wall and membrane of th e treated bacteria were  significantly damaged . \n \nKey word index: Clove oil, oregano oil, antibacteria l activity, thymol, eugenol, mechanism \nof action, Mycobacterium .",
