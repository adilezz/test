# Theses.ma - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Testing Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the theses.ma platform, covering both backend API testing and frontend UI testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

## Testing Framework Architecture

### Backend Testing
- **Framework**: pytest + httpx for API testing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL test database with fixtures
- **Authentication**: Mock JWT tokens for different user roles
- **File Handling**: Mock file uploads and metadata extraction

### Frontend Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design testing
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance testing

## Test Categories

### 1. Backend API Tests
- Authentication & Authorization
- CRUD Operations for all entities
- Search & Filtering functionality
- File upload & metadata extraction
- Error handling & validation
- Performance & load testing

### 2. Frontend UI Tests
- User authentication flows
- Search & discovery workflows
- Admin management workflows
- Form validation & error handling
- Responsive design & accessibility
- Cross-browser compatibility

### 3. Integration Tests
- End-to-end user journeys
- API-Frontend integration
- Database transactions
- File processing pipeline

### 4. Security Tests
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Role privilege escalation
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload security
- XSS prevention

## Critical User Flows to Test

### Public User Flows
1. **Homepage Navigation**
   - Landing page loads correctly
   - Search functionality works
   - Statistics display properly
   - Featured theses are shown

2. **Search & Discovery**
   - Basic search functionality
   - Advanced search with filters
   - Search result pagination
   - Thesis detail page navigation

3. **Thesis Interaction**
   - View thesis details
   - Download thesis PDF
   - Navigate between theses

### Authenticated User Flows
1. **User Registration & Login**
   - Registration form validation
   - Login with valid/invalid credentials
   - Password change functionality
   - Profile management

2. **Thesis Upload (if applicable)**
   - File upload process
   - Form validation
   - Metadata entry

### Admin User Flows
1. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Dashboard loads with statistics
   - Navigation between admin sections

2. **Entity Management**
   - Create new entities (universities, faculties, etc.)
   - Edit existing entities
   - Delete entities with proper validation
   - Search and filter entities

3. **Thesis Management**
   - Upload new thesis
   - Edit thesis metadata
   - Manage thesis relationships (authors, categories, keywords)
   - Approve/reject thesis workflow

4. **Reference Data Management**
   - Manage hierarchical structures
   - Bulk operations (future feature preparation)
   - Data validation and constraints

## Key Problem Areas to Test

### 1. Authentication & Security
- JWT token expiration handling
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password security

### 2. Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Hierarchical data consistency
- Multilingual data validation
- File upload validation

### 3. Performance
- Search response times
- Large dataset handling
- File upload performance
- Database query optimization

### 4. User Experience
- Form validation feedback
- Error message clarity
- Loading states
- Responsive design

### 5. Metadata Extraction
- PDF processing accuracy
- AI extraction confidence scoring
- Manual review workflow
- Error handling for corrupted files

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Data Needed
- Test universities with faculties and departments
- Sample academic persons
- Test categories and keywords
- Sample theses with various metadata
- Test PDF files for upload testing
- User accounts with different roles

### Mock Data Strategy
- Consistent test data for reproducible tests
- Edge case data for boundary testing
- Multilingual test data
- Large dataset simulation for performance testing

## Testing Environment Setup

### Database
- Separate test database
- Automated schema setup/teardown
- Test data fixtures
- Transaction rollback for test isolation

### File System
- Test upload directory
- Sample PDF files
- Cleanup procedures

### External Services
- Mock AI metadata extraction
- Mock email services (if applicable)
- Test API endpoints

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing Pipeline
- Run tests on every commit
- Run full test suite on pull requests
- Deploy to staging after successful tests
- Performance regression testing

### Test Reporting
- Detailed test reports
- Coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scan results

## Questions for Implementation

1. **Testing Scope**: Should we include load testing for search functionality?
2. **AI Testing**: How should we test the metadata extraction accuracy?
3. **Mobile Testing**: What devices/screen sizes are priority?
4. **Accessibility**: What WCAG level should we target?
5. **Performance**: What are the acceptable response time thresholds?
6. **Data Privacy**: How should we handle test data that might contain real information?

## Next Steps

1. Set up testing infrastructure
2. Create test data fixtures
3. Implement backend API tests
4. Implement frontend UI tests
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Create test documentation
7. Establish testing best practices

This comprehensive testing strategy will ensure the theses.ma platform works reliably and meets user expectations across all functionality areas.
